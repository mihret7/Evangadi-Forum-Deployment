## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihret7/Evangadi-Forum
   cd Evangadi-Forum
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   - Copy the sample environment file and update it with your credentials:
     ```bash
     cp .env.sample .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` and set your MySQL credentials (default values are provided for XAMPP):
     ```env
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=evangadi_admin
     DB_PASSWORD=password
     DB_NAME=evangadi_forum
     DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
     ```

4. **Start MySQL Server**

   - If using XAMPP, open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the MySQL service.

5. **Run App and Initialize the Database**

   - Initially since there is not db yet, please don't forget to comment out the line code on number 9 inside app.js which is `const result = await dbconnection.execute("SELECT 'test'");`

     5.1. **Start the Backend Server**

   ```bash
    node app.js
   # or for development with auto-reload
   npx nodemon app.js # install nodemon first
   ```

   - The server will run at: [http://localhost:5400](http://localhost:5400)

   - Run the following endpoint in your browser or with a tool like Postman to create the database and user:
     ```
     http://localhost:5400/initdb
     ```
   - You should see a success message if everything is set up correctly.

6. **Create Tables**
   - First uncomment the previous line code, and continue development.
   - Run the following endpoint to create all necessary tables:
     ```
     http://localhost:5400/create
     ```
